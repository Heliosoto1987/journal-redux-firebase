Project that I am developing in the course of Fernando Herrera for stack mern and I am specifically practicing redux and authentications with firebase and firestore.
To have it on your pc you just have to apply the following commands.
git clone https://github.com/Heliosoto1987/journal-redux-firebase.git
npm install
npm start
